1)InterThread comunication by using event:
------------------------------------------
   METHODS
****************
   e = Event()
   a) set() ==>> e.set() ==>   # there are much thread which was in waiting for the state they become continue their execution.
   b) clear() ==>> e.clear() ==>  # which thread is not running or already in waiting, so they are still is in waiting
                                      for state and donâ€™t continue there execution.
   c) wait() ==>>e.wait() ==> the wait() method in simple words we can say that thread waits until the execution of the
                              set() method . We can use time in it if we set a certain time then the execution will
                              stop until time overs after that it will execute still the set() of an event is remaining.
   d) isSet() ==>> e.isSet() ==> this method simplifies that the following event that we have created are set or not
